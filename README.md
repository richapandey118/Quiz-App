## How to Run

This is a frontend-only application, so you can run it directly in your web browser.

1.  Ensure you have the following files in the same directory:
    -   `index.html`
    -   `styles.css`
    -   `app.js`

2.  Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

Alternatively, you can use a simple local server (requires Node.js and npm):

1.  Ensure you have `server.js` and `package.json` in the project directory (these were created if you followed the previous steps for setting up the server).
2.  Open your terminal in the project directory.
3.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  Start the server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
5.  Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

Enjoy the quiz!
